## Standards

- Shell scripts generally adheres to the [Google "shellguide"](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html), but use POSIX-compatible scripts and the `#!/bin/sh` executable rather than `#!/bin/bash`.
- Decisions are documented as "Any Decision Records" using the ["Markdown Any Decision Records (MADR) format](https://adr.github.io/madr/).
